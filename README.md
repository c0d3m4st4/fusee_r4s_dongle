# Fusee launcher for R4S dongle

If you like my work, you can... <a href='https://ko-fi.com/E1E0BN94' target='_blank'><img height='36' style='border:0px;height:36px;' src='https://az743702.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/kofi4.png?v=0' border='0' alt='Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com' /></a>

Based on [atlas44](https://github.com/atlas44) sam-fusee-launcher (https://github.com/atlas44/sam-fusee-launcher)

Current code seems to run slower on the R4S dongle than in a trinket M0. Dunno why. Feel free to fork and improve, or PR.

The dongle seems to be using a SAM D21E microcontroller with the red LED on PA16.

Read the PDF manual for update instructions. You will have to create your own update files, as i won't provide any apart from the included one so you can compile the source code.

Have fun!
